## Deploying to Vercel

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Web Interface (Recommended)

1. Create a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) if you don't have one already
2. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
3. Visit [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) to import your project
4. Select your Git repository and follow the setup instructions
5. Configure the required environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your production URL (will be provided by Vercel)
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secure secret for NextAuth
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (if using Google auth)
6. Click "Deploy" and wait for your project to build

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. Install the Vercel CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Login to Vercel:
```bash
vercel login
```

3. Run the deployment command:
```bash
vercel
```

4. Follow the interactive prompts to configure your project
5. For production deployment:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

If you encounter build errors:

1. Check that all required environment variables are set
2. Ensure your MongoDB connection is accessible from Vercel's servers
3. Review the build logs for specific errors
4. Make sure your Next.js configuration is compatible with Vercel deployment

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

```
# Database
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=your-production-url
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-strong-secret-key

# Google Auth (if used)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
